## **[5.0.0]**

### **Release Notes**

### BREAKING CHANGE

This major release introduces Media over QUIC (MoQ) playback, bringing next-generation streaming with ultra-low latency and real-time playback powered by modern web technologies like QUIC and WebCodecs. This unlocks smoother, more interactive streaming experiences while still maintaining full compatibility with proven playback modes such as WebSocket/MSE and H5Live-HLS.
Playback control has also been improved. You can now set the player volume directly at startup, and the player performs smarter connection checks to ensure QUIC compatibility before playback begins.
We have optimized the default settings to deliver faster startup times, lower latency, and more reliable adaptive streaming. When multiple quality levels are available, the player will automatically use adaptive bitrate (ABR).
Finally, we have cleaned up outdated and rarely used features. Flash player and legacy iOS ≤ 9 native-HLS fallback modes have been removed, configuration options have been simplified, and older scaling modes have been retired to ensure a more consistent playback experience.

### **Changelog**

### **Release Notes**  

This update introduces improved error observability and enhanced player responsiveness.
Startup errors now include detailed insights, making it easier to identify and resolve playback issues during the initial loading phase, including the first 30 seconds of playback.
For full details, refer to our [Startup Errors Documentation](https://docs.nanocosmos.de/docs/nanoplayer/nanoplayer_api_errors#startup-errors).
Additionally, the player’s resizing behavior has been optimized, ensuring a smoother experience when the container dimensions change.
These enhancements ensure a more reliable and user-friendly experience.

### **Changelog**

### **Added**

- enhanced observability with additional information in the error event when identified as a startup error:
  - errors occurring during playback attempts in the initial loading phase, including the first 30 seconds of playback
  - for details, see [Startup Errors Documentation](https://docs.nanocosmos.de/docs/nanoplayer/nanoplayer_api_errors#startup-errors)

### **Improved**

## **[4.26.0]**

### **Release Notes**

This version includes several improvements. Playback attempts on mobile devices failing due to visibility state hidden at load start will now result in a dedicated event `1009`. This allows for clearer differentiation from other startup errors, such as network or stream issues `2003 Not enough media data received`. Further we improved playback start behavior in iOS WebView apps, which require user interaction for video playback in their WebView settings. Now, if a playback attempt is rejected due to missing user interaction, the player will emit error `1005` early on, allowing the application to prompt the user for interaction more quickly. Refer to recommended settings for iOS WebView: <https://docs.nanocosmos.de/docs/nanoplayer/nanoplayer_webview#ios>. In general find more information about error codes here: <https://docs.nanocosmos.de/docs/nanoplayer/nanoplayer_api#NanoPlayer..errorcode>.

### **Changelog**

### Improved

- playback attempts on mobile devices failing due to visibility state `hidden` will now result in a dedicated error event with code `1009` and message `Playback failed because the player was in visibility state 'hidden' at load start.`
  - allowing to distinguish from network or stream related startup errors, e.g. `2003 Not enough media data received.`

### Fixed

- playback start behaviour in iOS WebView apps requiring user interaction for video playback `mediaTypesRequiringUserActionForPlayback`
  - in case of a playback attempt rejected due to missing user interaction, the player will now emit error `1005 Playback must be initialized by user gesture.` early on
  - this enables the application to handle the condition faster by asking the user to interact
  - see recommended settings for iOS WebView: <https://docs.nanocosmos.de/docs/nanoplayer/nanoplayer_webview#ios>

This version fixes an issue that occurred when attempting media error recovery immediately after a switch stream fail on iOS. The issue was introduced in version 4.20.2. Additionally, an issue related to the `interactionrequired` error with code `1005` on iOS has been resolved. The `onStreamInfo` event will now be fired correctly before the `onError` and `onPause` events. This problem was introduced with the release of version 4.20.3.

Furthermore, a minor issue regarding the automute feature at delayed play attempts without prior or direct user interaction has been fixed. The same applies to unmute attempts without user interaction during playback, that was started in `muted` state. These attempts will now result in muted playback or, in the case of automute being disabled, in error `1005`.

### **Changelog**

### Fixed

- issue in case of a media error recovery immediately after a switch stream fail
- correct emitting of `onStreamInfo` in case of the error `1005` `interactionrequired` on iOS

### **Changelog**

### Fixed

- issue in context of a media error occuring during an ongoing stream switch

## **[4.20.2]**

### **Release Notes**

This version is adding further improvements for error handling and automatic recovery on iOS.
The improvements include detection and automatic recovery in cases of stalled video playback due to
decoding issues and in cases of buffering errors that could formerly lead to playback stopping.
For further informations see the [feature description](https://docs.nanocosmos.de/docs/nanoplayer/nanoplayer_feature_media_error_recovery/) for media error recoveries
and the `errorcode` [definitions](https://docs.nanocosmos.de/docs/nanoplayer/nanoplayer_api#nanoplayererrorcode--codenumbercode) in the documentation.

Another improvement is related to `updateSource` API calls made during LOADING state.
Until now, `updateSource` API calls made during LOADING state could run into a loading timeout,
especially if initiated late in the loading phase. This will now be prevented by removing
the loading timeout in case of an `updateSource` API call during LOADING state.

The current playback time values in `onStats` events are now increasing continuously without setbacks
after stream switches and error recoveries on iOS to be consistent with other platforms.

Furthermore an issue related to failing rejections of unmuted autoplay on iOS has been fixed.
The issue has been introduced in version 4.19.

### **Changelog**

### Added

- detection and automatic recovery of stalled video playback due to decoding issues on iOS
  - related error: `3005` - `'An error occurred while hls playback when decoding video.'`
- detection and automatic recovery of buffering errors on iOS
  - related error: `3101` - `'An error occurred while buffering on hls playback.'`
- see `errorcode` [definitions](https://docs.nanocosmos.de/docs/nanoplayer/nanoplayer_api#nanoplayererrorcode--codenumbercode)
- see [feature](https://docs.nanocosmos.de/docs/nanoplayer/nanoplayer_feature_media_error_recovery/) description

### Improved

- timeout handling in case of `updateSource` API calls during LOADING state
- current playback time monotonically increasing after stream switches and recoveries on iOS

### Fixed

- failing rejections of unmuted autoplay on iOS

## **[4.19.2]**

Playback interruptions in context of stream switches in iOS low power mode have been fixed.
Furthermore robustness for fullscreen handling in multi-player use cases has been increased.
The improvement for classic playback on iOS 15 to avoid buffer impacts after adjusting latency has now been applied for iOS 16 as well.
This was introduced in version 4.15.0.

### **Changelog**

### Improved

- automatic error recovery during an ongoing stream switch on iOS
- playback speed ~1.0 on iOS 16 as standard to reduce rebuffering effects after latency adjustment

### Fixed

- playback interruptions in context of stream switches in iOS low power mode
- fullscreen handling with multiple player instances
- unreasoned configuration warnings for event handlers `onServerInfo` and `onFullscreenChange`

## Please find more about **secure playback with JWT** in our [documentation](https://docs.nanocosmos.de/docs/nanoplayer/nanoplayer_token_security/)

## **[4.18.0]**

### **Release Notes**

This version is introducing two new features.

Utilizing the new bintu stream group feature, it is now possible to configure an entire set of ABR streams
by passing only the corresponding bintu stream group id via the player source configuration.
This allows a much easier configuration for ABR playback.
All existing options that are part of the configuration remain unchanged.

Please find more about the **stream group configuration** feature in our [documentation](https://docs.nanocosmos.de/docs/nanoplayer/nanoplayer_feature_stream_group_configuration/).

Furthermore, this version is adding support for the new secure playback using JSON Web Token (JWT).
The new token type can contain playback permissions for one or more stream names.
This way a single token can be used for all secure use cases.
It can be applied with the current `entries` configuration and with the new `group` configuration.

Please find more about **secure playback with JWT** in our [documentation](https://docs.nanocosmos.de/docs/nanoplayer/nanoplayer_token_security/).

Since this version, the nanoStream Player will not attempt to autoplay non live streams configured via bintu stream ID or bintu group ID after the `setup` call.
Instead it will pause with reason `'sourcestreamstopped'` and emit the error event 2004 with message `'The source stream has been stopped.'`.
This will enable the nanoStream Player to properly initialize in the setup method and allow users to reattempt playback even if the stream was not in `live` state at the time of the initialization.

### **Changelog**

### Added

- stream group configuration via `config.source.group` object
  - see [feature](https://docs.nanocosmos.de/docs/nanoplayer/nanoplayer_feature_stream_group_configuration/) description
- support for secure playback using JSON Web Token (JWT)
  - see [feature](https://docs.nanocosmos.de/docs/nanoplayer/nanoplayer_token_security/) description

### Improved

- player setup with bintu stream ID or bintu group ID if the stream in not `live`

## Please find more about the **video processing** feature in our [documentation](https://docs.nanocosmos.de/docs/nanoplayer/nanoplayer_feature_video_processing/)

## **[4.17.0]**

### **Release Notes**

This version is adding a new public event to the player. The event `onActiveVideoElementChange` is emitted when the active video element for playback has been created and if the element has been changed in case of a stream switch on iOS. The event data is providing the `activeVideoElement` and the complete `videoElementList`.
Having a reference to the `activeVideoElement` simplifies use cases like drawing or rendering images to a canvas or saving snapshots from the video.
See the [api description](https://docs.nanocosmos.de/docs/nanoplayer/nanoplayer_api#onactivevideoelementchange) of the event and our [docs feature entry](https://docs.nanocosmos.de/docs/nanoplayer/nanoplayer_feature_video_access_and_processing/) for more information.

### **Changelog**

### Added

- new public event `onActiveVideoElementChange`
  - is emitted when the active video element for playback has been created and if the element has been changed in case of a stream switch on iOS
  - provides the `videoElementList` {Array.HTMLVideoElement} and the `activeVideoElement` {HTMLVideoElement} in the event data
  - see the [api description](https://docs.nanocosmos.de/docs/nanoplayer/nanoplayer_api#onactivevideoelementchange)

## **[4.16.0]**

### **Release Notes**

This version adds the possibility to set a general H5Live server domain. A domain can be applied via `config.source.general.serverDomain`. This can be especially useful with configurations via `source.defaults` or `bintu.streamid`. By default, these configurations are using the standard geo-load-balanced domain namest. Please find further information in our [documentation](https://docs.nanocosmos.de/docs/nanoplayer/nanoplayer_feature_source_defaults#applying-a-custom-h5live-server-domain) regarding this feature.

In addition an issue in relation to timed out stream switches has been fixed. Previously this could lead to a temporarily inconsistent internal stream state.

### **Changelog**

### Added

- new config parameter `config.source.general.serverDomain`
  - will override/modify all h5live server domains

### Fixed

- internal stream state after timed out stream switches

## **[4.15.0]**

### **Release Notes**

This version is adding improvements for ABR playback. It implements a cooldown mechanism to control the next up-switch.
Too frequent up- & down-switches will be prevented. This improves the user experience especially in case of slight but frequent buffer impacts e.g. in case of limited network ressources.
Furthermore this release includes an improvement for classic playback on iOS 15 to avoid buffer impacts after adjusting latency.
Also the visual switching behaviour on iOS has been improved to prevent a possible black frame effect.

### **Changelog**

### Added

- ABR upswitch cooldown mechanism to avoid too frequent up- & down-switches in certain scenarios

### Improved

- playback speed ~1.0 on iOS 15 as standard to reduce rebuffering effects after latency adjustment
- z-index only for video element switch on iOS to avoid black frame effect

## **[4.14.2]**

### **Release Notes**

This release is solving issues related to the center view player controls and the layout in fullscreen mode.
Previously in case the bottom control bar was disabled, the center view player control did not trigger related actions. It occured after a resize of the player e.g. upon entering the fullscreen mode or mobile device rotation.
Furthermore a fullscreen layout issue has been resolved. Before, parts of the player were not being rendered inside of the display area under following circumstances: If CSS padding was set on the player div and the player's aspect ratio did not match the form factor of the screen.

### **Changelog**

### Fixed

- center view player controls not triggering related actions if the bottom control bar was disabled
  - the issue occurred after a resize of the player (e.g. mobile device rotation or entering fullscreen mode)
- potential layout issue in fullscreen mode
  - if CSS padding was set on the player div and the player's aspect ratio did not match the form factor of the screen

## **[4.14.1]**

### **Release Notes**

This release introduces two new latency control modes targeting especially lowest latency use cases like live auctioning.
The latency control mode can be selected via the added `config.playback.latencyControlMode` configuration parameter.
The established latency control mode is available as the `'classic'` option which remains to be the default mode.
In addition the new latency control modes `'balancedadaptive'` and `'fastadaptive'` have been added.
According to the current stream and network conditions they can adjust the latency adaptively.
This allows to achieve a lower latency while keeping the playback experience smooth.
Please find further information in our [feature description](https://docs.nanocosmos.de/docs/nanoplayer/nanoplayer_feature_latency_control_modes/) in the documentation.

### **Changelog**

### Added

- added latency control modes and related configuration parameter
  - configuration parameter: `config.playback.latencyControlMode`
  - string values: `'classic'`, `'balancedadaptive'`, `'fastadaptive'`

### Improved

- improved handling in case of video frames being dropped by the browser

## **[4.13.3]**

### **Release Notes**

This version includes a fix for a potential CSS layout issue in iOS fullscreen mode,
that could lead to page elements unintendedly being displayed above the video layer.
The issue has been introduced in version 4.13.2.

### **Changelog**

### Fixed

- CSS layout issue in iOS fullscreen mode

## **[4.13.2]**

### **Release Notes**

This version provides an improvement for iOS metadata processing. The new mode is preventing occasionally delayed metadata on iOS and is enabled by default.
To go back to legacy mode it can be disabled by setting the new parameter `config.playback.metadataLowDelay` to `false`.
Also an issue with changing the metadata connection at stream switch on iOS with switch method `'client'` has been solved.
Further this patch includes a fix for a potential css related layout issue in iOS fullscreen mode.

### **Changelog**

### Improved

- modified metadata processing to prevent occasionally delayed metadata on iOS
  - can be disabled via new parameter `config.playback.metadataLowDelay` set to `false`
  - default: `true`

### Fixed

- change metadata connection on iOS at stream switch with switch method `'client'`
- prevent iOS fullscreen layout issue by adding `!important` flag to position

## **[4.13.1]**

### **Release Notes**

This version includes a patch regarding the player's `style.scaling` configuration and `updateSource`. If `style.scaling` is set to a different value as default `'letterbox'` e.g. `'crop'` or `'fill'`
this setting will now always be preserved during an `updateSource` call.
Before the player styling was
falling back to default values after an server-side updateSource call if the new target stream name
and the previous stream name were the same.
Further an issue with `updateSource` in `PAUSED` state with `source.options.switch.forcePlay` set to `false` and ABR enabled is solved, preventing unintended switching in `PAUSED` state.

### **Changelog**

### Fixed

- `style.scaling` with non-default value will be preserved during `updateSource` with server-side switch to the same stream
- initial switch up interval with ABR configured `source` will be prevented from starting in `PAUSED` state

## **[4.13.0]**

### **Release Notes**

This version introduces the new **source defaults** feature that simplifies the source configuration by adding `defaults.service` to the `config.source` object. If a service is set, the `h5live.server` object and the `h5live.rtmp.url` in each entry can be omitted. In this case defaults will be applied internally. Values for `h5live.server` and/or `h5live.rtmp.url` that are defined explicitly in the entry have priority. The available value for `defaults.service` is `'bintu'` for using the standard **nanoStream Cloud**. See our [docs feature entry](https://docs.nanocosmos.de/docs/nanoplayer/nanoplayer_feature_source_defaults/) for more information.
Furthermore this release includes improvements in preventing exceptions in case of DOM access restrictions or unreachable DOM elements.
A last change is regarding the metrics module of the player. The minimum value of the `metrics.statsInterval` parameter has been raised to `5` seconds.

### **Changelog**

### Added

- new `config.source` parameter `defaults.service` for simplifying configuration if the standard nanoStream Cloud is used

### Improved

- handling of DOM access restrictions or unreachable DOM elements

### Changed

- minimum value of `metrics.statsInterval` set from `1` to `5` seconds

## **[4.12.1]**

### **Release Notes**

It could happen that the player becomes invisible at first fullscreen entering. Furthermore it is containing a minor fix related to config source `params` object and multi stream configuration.

### **Changelog**

### Fixed

- player invisibility issue at fullscreen enter on iOS with special CSS position settings
- config source `params` object usage with multi stream configuration

## **[4.12.0]**

### **Release Notes**

This version is adding the option to configure the minimum number steps during an ABR initialized switch down via the `adaption.downStep` parameter. Potential related use case are configurations containing a higher number of qualities or configurations with rather close rendition bitrates.
The detection of the available buffer time has been improved for iOS in general and iOS 15 in particular.
A timing related condition that could lead to buffering after a stream switch has been fixed.
The start-buffer calculation in `bufferDynamic` mode has been fixed to prevent out of range values.
Assigning `null` values to non mandatory configuration parameters will no longer lead to a setup error.

### **Changelog**

### Added

- new option `config.source.options.adaption.downStep`
  - for ABR automatic 'deviationOfMean' and 'deviationOfMean2' only
  - allows to define the minimum number of steps during a ABR initialized down switch via the `adaption` object
  - if the number of remaining lower renditions is smaller than the value then the switch will be performed to the lowest rendition
  - default value is `1`
  - e.g.:

    ````javascript
    "adaption": {
        "rule": "deviationOfMean2",
        "downStep": 2
    }
    ````

### Improved

- detection of the available buffer time for iOS in general and iOS 15 in particular
- config warning message in case of wrong configured properties of an entry

### Fixed

- timing related condition that could lead to buffering after a stream switch
- start-buffer calculation in cooldown if `bufferDynamic` is enabled
  - prevent lower values than the original configured start buffer value
- assigning `null` values to non mandatory configuration parameters will no longer lead to a setup error

## **[4.6.1]**

### **Release Notes**

By enabling the `source.options.switch.forcePlay` config property a paused playback starts after the execution of a 'switchStream' or 'updateSource' request. This obviates the need for an additional play call.
To improve the overall switching behavior paused switch completion has been added, meaning a pending 'switchStream' or 'updateSource' request will be completed as the player enters the paused state.
The related completion event either 'switchStreamSuccess' or 'updateSourceSuccess' will be emitted to the application level.

This version prevents an occasional CPU load issue on Firefox.
To provide additional information to the client metrics the new public event 'onServerInfo' has been added.
Version 4.6.1 implements an updated version of the Bintu-Client API internally.

### **Changelog**

### Improved

- minor metrics adjustment

## **[4.5.1]**

### **Release Notes**

This version implements seamless ABR and stream switching for iOS and iPadOS devices which works with 2 video elements internally.
In special use cases where external video elements are used for playback an array of maximal two external video element IDs can be provided via the `playback.videoId` config property.
**Important note:** On iOS devices the default z-index of the video layer had to be changed from 0 to 1. In case of using custom controls or overlays please make sure to use a z-index > 1.

The new ABR mode, adaption rule, 'deviationOfMean2' has been added. The new rule is slightly less strict and especially recommended  for streams that are already more volatile on the source/ingest side.  

This version adjusts the default timeout for the update source request to 20 seconds to improve the overall switching behavior.

The `style.displayMutedAutoplay` config property is re-enabled which shows a muted audio symbol in case of muted autoplay.
The `style.displayMutedAutoplay` option can be disabled to maintain the recent behaviour.
The handling of mute states and autoplay has been improved.

### **Changelog**

### Added

- seamless ABR and stream switching for iOS and iPadOS devices
- new adaption rule 'deviationOfMean2'

### Improved

- iOS & iPadOS seamless stream switching  needs 2 video elements internally. So for special use cases where existing video tags need to be used for playback an array of maximal two element Ids can be provided via the `playback.videoId` config property (NOT mandatory)
  - if 0 Ids are provided 2 video elements will be created internally
  - if 1 Id is provided the other video element will be created internally
- set the default timeout for the update source request to 20 seconds to improve the overall switching behavior
  - can be configured via the `source.options.switch.timeout` config property (we advise to use default value)
- re-enabled `style.displayMutedAutoplay` config property to show a muted audio symbol in case of muted autoplay
- handling of mute states and autoplay

## **[4.3.2]**

### **Release Notes**

This version introduces the 'setAdaption' API to switch between adaption rules (ex. enable/disable ABR).
Furthermore, this version implements optimizations for the ABR feature and minor internal, config and metrics adjustments. Additionally, this version prevents non-critical console errors during initialization and fixes a timeout error during client-side switchStream/updateSource.

## **[4.1.0]**

### **Release Notes**

This version introduces adaptive bitrate (ABR) playback where the player switches between a set of streams with different qualities to accommodate challenging network situations and avoid buffering and frame drops.
A set of stream sources (entries) is expected inside the 'entries' array of the config's 'source' object. Each entry represents an indexed quality step starting with the highest quality at index 0. The 'startIndex' property sets the entry that should be used for inializing the playback.
The config's 'source' object now holds an 'options' object to set the ABR 'rule' (algorithm) inside the 'adaption' object and the switch options inside the 'switch' object.
To manually switch between entries the new 'switchStream' API is used which comes along with 4 new public events and error codes.

Please find more about the stream switching & ABR feature in our [documentation]( https://docs.nanocosmos.de/docs/nanoplayer/nanoplayer_feature_stream_switching/).

### **Changelog**

### Improved

- config object:
  - entries: keeps a set of indexed stream sources which represent a quality step
  - options:
    - adaption: set ABR rule
    - switch: set switch settings
  - startIndex: sets the entry used for inializing the playback
- 'switchStream' API:
  - use to switch between entries
  - new public events: 'onSwitchStreamInit', 'onSwitchStreamSuccess', 'onSwitchStreamAbort' and 'onSwitchStreamFail'
  - new error code:  
    - 1010: in case an invalid entry index is given as parameter over 'switchStream'
- 'updateSource' API:
  - use to set a new source (ex. with different entries, adaption/switch options)
  - the updateSource method now uses the switch options set inside the config's source object instead of the parameters supplied via the method call

## **[4.0.8]**

- improved playback in desktop browsing mode on iPadOS

## **[3.18.5]**

### **Release Notes**

This version patches the usage of the 'params' object of the config source object. Now it isn't necessary to pass 'url' & 'stream' if no 'source.h5live.rtmp' object is present.

### **Changelog**

### Fixed

- remove check for rtmp queries 'url' & 'stream' in 'params' object of the source config

## **[3.18.4]**

### **Release Notes**

This version fixes a small bug with buffer config validation.

### **Changelog**

- use 'hasOwnProperty' in buffer config validation

## **[3.18.3]**

### **Release Notes**

This version brings an improvement for the playback stability under higher cpu/gpu load influence like heavy load in browsers caused by complex WebGL animations.

### **Changelog**

### Improved

- optimized playback stability in case of high general cpu/gpu load

## **[3.18.2]**

### **Release Notes**

This release is adding two configuration options to the config.style section.
style.backgroundColor allows custom background colors via the config.
style.fullScreenControl allows to show/hide the full-screen button in the inline player controls.

### **Changelog**

### Added

- new config parameter 'style.backgroundColor' to enable custom background colors in the player div
- new config parameter 'style.fullScreenControl' to show or hide the full-screen button in the inline player controls

````javascript
config.style.backgroundColor = 'black'
config.style.fullScreenControl = true
````

### Improved

- browser version detection for Safari macOS

## **[3.18.1]**

### **Release Notes**

This release brings the possibility to allow H5Live low latency HLS playback as fallback for Safari on Mac OS X. If enabled the player will decide for Safari Mac OS X the playback method and utilize H5Live low latency HLS if appropriate.
Another feature is that we added the quality stats to the metrics stats event. Also several little patches are included in this release. Now for bintu sources without explicit 'h5live' playout object in the response the rtmp object will be choosen and a missing server object in the h5live config will be catched.
An 'undefined' error at destroy is fixed too. Now also playback will always be recovered on Edge if frames are dropped and the player is visible.

### **Changelog**

### Added

- new config parameter 'playback.allowSafariHlsFallback' to enable selecting the playback method in Safari Mac OS X and utilize H5Live low latency HLS if appropriate (default:false)

````javascript
config.playback.allowSafariHlsFallback = true
````

- send quality values in metrics stats event

### Fixed

- use bintu rtmp playout object in case h5live rtmp object isn't defined
- catch missing server object in config
- fix 'undefined' error at destroy
- always recover playback on Edge at frame dropping if player is visible

## **[3.17.4]**

### **Release Notes**

This release improves and stabilizes the metrics play event stats collection, the playback stats collection and the general metrics event error handling. There are some checks added to avoid playback interupts in case of metrics collection errors.
Further the stats object in the flash fallback is updated with all possible properties. Before this resulted in an error at metrics collection.

### **Changelog**

### Improved

- catch errors in metrics module
- check play event stats and playback stats in metrics module for consistancy

### Fixed

- update stats object for flash fallback with all possible properties

## **[3.17.3]**

### **Release Notes**

This release contains several patches. One patch fixes a potential problem with autoplay policies regarding the play promise implementation of certain browsers. The main problem were side effects with the promise wrapper of the player and some third party libs which manipulate promises. In this cases the promise always resolved, also in case of an play start error.
Another patch addresses a bug in Microsoft Edge 18. We removed the 'MediaSource.isTypeSupported' check for all Edge versions because of an inconsistancy in Edge 18.
Further a bug in the 'updateSource' function for iOS is fixed. Also now the full screen icon on Chrome changes correctly.

### **Changelog**

### Fixed

- change media play promise wrapping to avoid side effects of promise manipulating third party libs
- remove 'MediaSource.isTypeSupported' check for all Microsoft Edge versions
- fix 'type undefined' error in 'updateSource' for iOS
- fix full screen icon change on Chrome

## **[3.17.2]**

### **Release Notes**

This release patches an issue with metrics fields type. Now the fields 'accountId', 'accountKey', 'userId', 'eventId', and 'customField1' - 'customField10' must be of type String. If one of the mentioned fields has a different type, it will be silently converted to String.

### **Changelog**

### Fixed

- convert metrics fields to String, if necessary

## **[3.17.1]**

### **Release Notes**

With this release comes a new feature. We added new error codes and pause reasons. The errors that can occure during 'loading', 'buffering' and 'playing' state are now more specific regarding the root cause.
We added the error code 1009 for playback fail in case of visibility hidden e.g. open a link as unfocused tab (ctrl + click). In this case the pause reason is 'visibilityhidden'.
Further not only error 2001 'stream not found' can happen with the loading timeout. If the stream was already connected and the stream info event was fired but not enough data was received the new error code 2003 will be fired. The new pause reason in this case is 'notenoughdata'.
Another new error code is 2004 that will be fired if the source stream has been stopped. This can happen during 'loading', 'buffering' and 'playing' state and results in a pause with reason 'sourcestreamstopped'. The last new error is 3100, a media error, that will be fired if the media source extension (exclude iOS) changes it's state to 'ended'. The pause reason is 'playbackerror'.
For further informations see the definitions for 'errorcode' (<https://demo.nanocosmos.de/nanoplayer/docs/nanoplayer/NanoPlayer.html#toc21__anchor>) and 'pausereason' (<https://demo.nanocosmos.de/nanoplayer/docs/nanoplayer/NanoPlayer.html#toc22__anchor>).
In addition we improved the h5live support detection and fixed with the behaviour on error code 3003 (MEDIA_DECODE_ERROR). Now the player don't try to replay automatically.

### **Changelog**

### Added

- new error codes:
  - 1009: Playback failed because the player was in visibility state 'hidden' at load start.
  - 2003: Not enough media data received. The stream was already connected and the stream info event was fired.
  - 2004: The source stream has been stopped.
  - 3100: The media source extension changed the state to 'ended'. NOT AVAILABLE FOR IOS.
- new pause reasons:
  - 'visibilityhidden': Paused because the player was not visible at load start.
  - 'notenoughdata': Paused by loading timeout. The stream was alive and connected but not enough data was received to start playback.
  - 'sourcestreamstopped': Paused because the source stream has been stopped.

### Improved

- h5live support detection

### Fixed

- don't restart on error code 3003 MEDIA_DECODE_ERROR

## **[3.16.0]**

### **Release Notes**

This release introduces new features and several patches. Now it's possible to configure playback timeouts via the new 'config.playback.timeouts' object. You can set timeouts for 'loading' and 'buffering' in a range of 10-60 seconds (default: 20) and for 'connecting' in a range of 5-30 seconds (default: 5). If the timeouts are reached, an error will be thrown and the player stops.
Another feature addresses the metrics. Now also the 'LOADING' event will be sent. Furthermore if the player restarts in case of 'updateSource' while in playing state the pause event will be triggered with the new pause reason 'playbackrestart' before the replay attempt.
The new version includes patches for the full screen functionality in general and for Internet Explorer (IE) in special. General the full screen icon changes now if exited by ESC and for IE the size is now correctly measured. Another patch fixes the volume change by the controls in IE.
Two patches address the bintu service. The first one fixes a bug if the view is disabled and the bintu stream is not live or the services rejects. Now no view will be created in case of an bintu error. The other one enables to use 'updateSource' with a bintu source. In general now within the 'updateSource' promise the error handling is improved too. Further there are patches for displaying muted autoplay correctly and hiding the playbutton in the middle if switching streams using 'updateSource' while playing.

### **Changelog**

### Added

- new object 'config.playback.timeouts' to configure the timeouts for 'loading', 'buffering' and 'connecting' in seconds

````javascript
config.playback.timeouts = {
    loading: 20,
    buffering: 20,
    connecting: 5
}
````

- the LOADING event will be sent through metrics
- new pause reason 'playbackrestart' in case of a pause for update source in playing state
- updateSource error handling

### Fixed

- full screen icon change if exited via ESC
- IE full screen sizing
- IE volume change via view controls
- hide view in case of bintu setup error if disabled via 'config.style.view=false'
- enable using a bintu source with 'updateSource'
- hide middle playbutton in case of a playback restart via 'updateSource'
- display muted autoplay icon till first 'unmute'

## **[3.15.6]**

### **Release Notes**

This version addresses an issue with the full screen functionality on iOS Safari. The player now can go full screen within nested iframes. NOTE: The iframe(s) must have the attribute 'allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen|true"]**' or just 'allowfullscreen'. Another issue adressed is the handling of stable playback after viewport lost on IE/Edge. Here the detection is improved to prevent misbehaviour in case of not related framedropping.

### **Changelog**

### Fixed

- enable full screen on iOS within nested iframe(s)
- detection of IE/Edge viewport issue for stable playback

### **Changelog**

### Fixed

- pass rtmp settings correctly in modified config object if bintu source is used

## **[3.15.3]**

### **Release Notes**

## **[3.14.1]**

### **Release Notes**

This version comes with some new features. The first one addresses the public 'onPlay' event. Now some startup stats will be passed in the event object. These values represent the different states during startup from 'connecting', 'connected', 'firstFragmentReceived', 'firstFrameRendered', 'playable' and at least 'playing', the total startup time.
The second feature is the new public event 'onDestroy'. This event is fired when the player is destroyed. In relation to that new feature we introduced the new pause reason 'destroy'. If the player is playing on destroy, the player will be paused with this new reason.

### **Changelog**

### Added

    console.log(error);
});
````

## **[3.12.5]**

### **Release Notes**

This version corrects two small issues. The playback wasn't stopped on iOS on tab change. Now on every 'focus lost' on mobile devices the playback will be paused with reason 'playbacksuspended'. The second fix addresses the 'playback started' detection on iOS.

## **[3.12.3]**

### **Release Notes**

One part of this release addresses the correct indication of an audio symbol in case of muted autoplay or audio only. The second issue that is adressed handles the muted state on reset after an unsuccessful (denied) muted autoplay (automuted) on iOS. The last improvement is related to the behaviour in case of multiple destroy calls.

### **Changelog**

### Fixed

### **Changelog**

### Fixed

- set 'config.playback.automute' to 'false' by default

## **[3.12.1]**

### **Release Notes**

This version fixes an issue related to repeated setup calls without destroy calls in between. Now during the setup call a destroy/clean up will be performed internally if required.

### **Changelog**

### Fixed

- destroy player at begining of setup call
- clean destroy

## **[3.12.0]**

### **Release Notes**

This version brings a new feature for autoplay. There is a new option 'config.playback.automute' (disabled by default) which enables muted autoplay on browsers with autoplay policies. In case the play call is rejected by a policy the player will be muted to autoplay.
Another feature is the option 'config.style.displayMutedAutoplay' (enabled by default) which shows a muted symbol if playback was started with autoplay and muted. There is also a small fix for detecting playing state on iOS.

### **Changelog**

### Added

- enable auto muted playback with autoplay set in case of browser autoplay policy restriction
  - can be set via 'config.playback.automute', default: false
- enable displaying a muted symbol on muted autoplay
  - can be set via 'config.style.displayMutedAutoplay', default: true

### Fixed

- playing state detection on iOS

## **[3.11.0]**

### **Release Notes**

This version introduces a new event 'onStreamInfoUpdate' to indicate stream format changes. The event object is the same like in 'onStreamInfo' with the changed values

### **Changelog**

### Added

- new h5live event 'onStreamInfoUpdate' to indicate stream format changes

## **[3.10.3]**

### **Release Notes**

This version fixes a small bug with building the capabilities array.

### **Changelog**

### Fixed

- capabilities array

## **[3.10.2]**

### **Release Notes**

This version fixes a small bug with es6 syntax.

### **Changelog**

### Fixed

- remove es6 syntax

## **[3.10.1]**

### **Release Notes**

This version improves the config handling and enables setting rtmp values over the params object.

### **Changelog**

### Fixed

- enable rtmp settings over 'config.source.h5live.params' without the 'config.source.h5live.rtmp' object
- config handling

## **[3.10.0]**

### **Release Notes**

This version brings a new config option. It's now possible to add custom query params to the connection string. For this there is the new object 'config.source.h5live.params'. Parameters can be added as key/value pair e.g.:

````javascript
config.source.h5live.params = {
    'url': 'rtmp://bintu-play.nanocosmos.de',
    'stream': 'dtHSa-aEWRT',
    'custom_param': 'very_custom'
}
````

In this example we pass directly the rtmp settings, 'url' and 'stream'. If a 'config.source.h5live.rtmp' object is declared, it will be overwritten. This will result for websocket in a connection string like this:

`wss://bintu-play.nanocosmos.de/h5live/stream/?url=rtmp%3A%2F%2Fbintu-play.nanocosmos.de%3A80%2Fplay&stream=dtHSa-aEWRT&custom_param=very_custom&cid=405498&pid=43377944190`

This version also contains fixes for a wrong buffering state detection on iOS and one for the view. In the view now a configured 'scaling' mode will be keeped over the whole lifetime of the player.

### **Changelog**

### Added

- new h5live source object 'params' to pass custom comnnection query parameters
  - can be added as key/value pairs

````javascript
config.source.h5live.params = {
    'url': 'rtmp://bintu-play.nanocosmos.de',
    'stream': 'dtHSa-aEWRT',
    'custom_param': 'very_custom'

The patches bring improvements for Microsoft Edge / IE and iOS. Also network related fixes are included.

### **Changelog**

### Added

- enable adaptive buffer handling (iOS already has one)
  - can be set via the 'config.tweaks.bufferDynamic' object (see doc for further info)

  - detect multiple bufferings and increase buffer if necessary
  - if stable playback is detected a stepwise cooldown will be processed

````javascript
bufferDynamic: {
    offsetThreshold: 2, //  The threshold time between two bufferings in seconds. If the measured value is lower, the buffer will be increased by offsetStep.
    offsetStep: 0.5, // The step to increase in seconds. Also the step to decrease in cooldown.
    cooldownTime: 10 // The time to check stable playback. If stable playback is detected, the buffer values will be decreased till original buffer values are reached.

## **[3.3.2]**

### **Release Notes**

This release brings many features. We introduce the new 'keepConnection' functionality (supported with h5live server 1.8.0.0 and higher).
This enables to have always a connection to the h5live server (websocket only), also if the player is not playing.
Another main feature is the new reconnect logic. It enables reconnects to the h5live server in case of recoverable network errors. If the player is playing, the playback resumes after a successful reconnect.
Related to the reconnect we added the value 'connectDelay' to the event 'onLoading', that if positive and not zero indicates that a reconnect is imminent.
Also now the network error 4503: service unavailable will be dispatched and passed through the 'onError' event.
For diagnostics of the websocket connection we now use 'performance.mark()' to log different states of the connection with timestamps.
In this release are also several fixes. There are fixes for the scaling functionality, the h5live source parsing with bintu rtmp playout object only and at least we removed flash test embed on player load.

### **Changelog**

### Added

- enable always keep connected for websocket to the h5live server (h5live server 1.8.0.0 and higher)
  - can be set via 'config.playback.keepConnection'
  - default: false
- enable reconnect in case of recoverable network errors (see docs), not supported on iOS with metadata disabled
  - can be set via the 'config.playback.reconnect' object
  - new player states 'RECONNECTION_IMMINENT' (13) and 'CONNECTION_ERROR' (14)
  - default:

````javascript
reconnect: {
    minDelay: 2, //  The minimum time to reconnect in seconds. The lowest possible value is 1 sec.
    maxDelay: 10, // The maximum time to reconnect in seconds.
    delaySteps: 10, // This number of steps till the maximum delay should reached.
    maxRetries: 10 // The maximum count of reconnect tries. If set to zero no reconnect will be done.
}
````

- add property 'connectDelay' to the 'event.data' object of 'onLoading'
  - the delay in milliseconds before start connecting to the server
  - positive if a reconnect is imminent, otherwise zero
- dispatch network error 4503: service unavailable
- add performance marks with timestamps (see <https://demo.nanocosmos.de/nanoplayer/docs/nanoplayer3/global.html#performancemarks>),
  the middle part of the name string is the elementId of the player container (not supported on Safari 11 OSX and iOS):
  - 'nano.[playerDivId]**.connecting'
  - 'nano.[playerDivId]**.connected'
  - 'nano.[playerDivId]**.disconnected'
  - 'nano.[playerDivId]**.resuming'
  - 'nano.[playerDivId]**.firstFragmentReceived'
  - 'nano.[playerDivId]**.firstFrameRendered'
- new public event 'onWarning' with a warning message

### Fixed

- remove flash test embed on player load
- enable h5live source with bintu rtmp playout object only
- fix missing scaling config property

## **[3.2.2]**

### **Release Notes**

In this release we added the opportunity to create an audio player without video functionality.
This can be enabled by setting in the style object of the config the new property 'audioPlayer' to 'true',
for example 'config.style.audioPlayer = true'.
Controls can be enabled/disabled. The size can be customized via 'width' and 'height'. Default is 640px * 51px.

### **Changelog**

### Added

- enable the creation of an audio player without video functionality via 'config.style.audioPlayer = true'
  - controls can be enabled/disabled
  - the size can be customized via 'width' and 'height'
  - default is 640px * 51px

## **[3.1.0]**

### **Release Notes**

With this release comes improvements for the playback on iOS devices.
We introduce an adaptive buffer control depending on the buffer requirements of the iOS video element
to achieve smooth playback while attempting to keep the latency as low possible.
The adaptive buffer control is enabled by default for iOS clients.
There is a direct correlation between the integrity of the rtmp source stream and the buffer requirements.

The second improvement is that it's now possible to configure the buffer settings also for iOS devices directly.
If the buffer tweaks will be set via config,
the adaptive buffer control will be disabled and the given value will be used as discret values.

### **Changelog**

### Added

- adaptive buffer control related to the buffer requirements on iOS
- enable setting buffer tweaks via config for iOS as discret values
- buffering detection for iOS

## **[3.0.2]**

### **Release Notes**

### BREAKING CHANGE

The automatic fallback to the nanoStream Cloud h5live server has been removed.
As a result providing the h5live.server configuration object is now mandatory,
except if the server configuration is done through the bintu API by providing a bintu source.
For playback from the nanoStream Cloud without the bintu API the following values have to be set.

````javascript
source.h5live.server.websocket = 'wss://bintu-h5live.nanocosmos.de:443/h5live/stream';
source.h5live.server.hls = 'https://bintu-h5live.nanocosmos.de:443/h5live/http/playlist.m3u8';
source.h5live.server.progressive = 'https://bintu-h5live.nanocosmos.de:443/h5live/http/stream.mp4';
````

For the On-Premise setup this server values have to be replaced with the own server urls.

### BREAKING CHANGE

The seperate configuration of the rtmp url for the fallback to flash player,
the source.rtmp object, has been removed. Instead the rtmp url and stream name
from the source.h5live.rtmp object will be used in this case.

Since this version the last video frame can be kept displayed after pausing the player,
instead of displaying a black frame. The related configuration option is
'style.keepFrame' = [true/false]**, which is enabled by default.

Support for playback of audio only streams has been added (at least server version 1.7 required).
An audio symbol can be displayed during the playback of an audio only stream.
The related configuration option is
'style.displayAudioOnly' = [true/false]**, which is enabled by default.

### **Changelog**

### Added

- add audio only support
- add new public event 'onStreamInfo' with an streamInfo object about audio/video in the stream
- change player behaviour to always keep frame
- new config flag 'style.keepFrame' (default = true)
- new config flag 'style.displayAudioOnly' (default = true)
